spec:
  # For debugginb you might want to run the job more often:
  # For example:
  # - Every 5 minutes: "*/5 * * * *"
  # - Let's say that now is 11:17 and you want to run it at minute 20: "20 * * * *"
  # Once you see the cronjob is working as expected, you can change it to run as needed for your use case.
  # For crypto price prediction, where patterns between features and targets (if any) are not stable,
  # it probably makes sense to run it every hour.
